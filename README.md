# spatial-rfcs — Architecture Governance Repository

This repository is the **single source of truth** for architecture governance of the Spatial Platform. It follows the Rust RFC model.

- `adr/` — Architecture Decision Records (`ADR-001` … `ADR-039`). Decisions are numbered and final.
- `rfc/` — RFCs. Proposals for any change to the Constitution-protected surfaces.
- `proposals/` — Early, unnumbered ideas. May be promoted to RFC.
- `experimental/` — Experimental specifications. Tested outside the kernel; promoted to a ratified spec or abandoned.
- `CONSTITUTION.md` — The supreme governing document. Protected surfaces, the 16 Architecture Principles, and change control.

## RFC Lifecycle

```
proposal → draft → proposed → accepted → ratified → superseded
                                   ↘ rejected
```

1. **Draft** — the RFC author drafts `rfc/RFC-NNNN-title.md` using the template.
2. **Proposed** — the RFC is submitted for Architecture Review.
3. **Accepted** — Architecture Board accepts the direction; implementation may begin in a feature branch.
4. **Ratified** — the change is merged and, if it touches the Constitution, the Constitution is amended.
5. **Superseded** — replaced by a newer RFC. Never deleted; history is preserved.

## Rules

- **No agent or team may modify a Constitution-protected path without a ratified RFC** (see `CONSTITUTION.md` §2).
- RFC numbers are assigned sequentially and never reused.
- Every ADR has an owner, a status, and references from the specifications that use it.
- Commit/PR bodies touching protected paths must cite `RFC-NNNN`.
